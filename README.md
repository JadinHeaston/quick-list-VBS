# quick-list-VBS
Lists all file within a provided directory.

This script simply goes through the directory provided by the user and grabs the file name (and extension).
This is inputed into a text file and left in the same directory as the script itself.
The search is no recursive, and will not return directory names.

Note: The script will overwrite previous lists that have been created.
